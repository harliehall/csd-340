                I have always enjoyed reading, and while it is getting harder to find time I do try to read a book once a month. I am a huge Nicholas Sparks fan, but I also enjoy many classics such as To Kill a Mockingbird. I have always found reading to be a great escape.

                <div class="card-content">
                I also try to time to go outside, and Hiking provides me with this option. I have found hiking can clear your head and allow you to see how beautiful nature can be. I live in a large city and it is nice to escape and see the beauty of the world.

                I don't know if Baseball is considered a hobby or not, but I feel as many games that I go to and keep track of, it should definitely qualify. I'm a huge St. Louis Cardinals fans and will always support them. I have went to Cardinals Games my whole life, and I'm beyond excited to this year with Molina, Pujols, and Wainwright finishing out this year together before retirement.

                After high school, I decided to continue my education at Indian Hills Community College and get my degree in Cybersecurity Administration. I enjoyed the technical program and how hands on it was and gained a lot of experience from it.

                During my time at Indian Hills, I did an internship my last semester. I interned at a local school district and learned so many different skills. Some of these skills were technical, but a good portion of these skills were interpersonal and really only the kind of skills that you gain from work experience.

                I currently work at a software company in St. Louis. This is why I decided to finish my Bachelors degree, plus I wanted a background in software development. In my position I test the quality of the software, and I absolutely love being able to find the little details that others usually miss.
